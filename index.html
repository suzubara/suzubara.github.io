						<h2 class="clearfix"><span>About Me</span><hr /></h2>
						<p>I am <strong>Suzanne&nbsp;Rozier</strong>, a web developer based in Brooklyn,&nbsp;New&nbsp;York. I graduated in 2010 from Vassar&nbsp;College, where I studied Film and Japanese, and gained an interest in media, marketing, production, and adaptation. I have significant experience in a variety of areas that demand refined communication and coordination skills, and I feel that being detail-oriented and able to organize information effectively are what lend to my being a quick learner and an efficient programmer.</p>

						<div class="rose" data-petal-count="3" data-petal-size="20" data-petal-gravity="0.5"></div>

						<p>I have been making websites for over ten years and am self-taught in HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. I am interested in creating accessible websites that are up to par with modern browser standards and reflect current trends in design and usability. I believe that the front-end is just as important as the back-end, that good design is essential for good functionality, and that websites should express the nature of the Internet as a fluid and dynamic environment. I am proficient in the HTML5 and CSS3 technologies which support these philosophies.</p>
						
						<div class="rose" data-petal-count="3" data-petal-size="20" data-petal-gravity="0.5"></div>
						
						<p>I spend a fair amount of my free time reading comics and playing video games. I like to think of the web as an emerging form of interactive media, and I am very interested in how it can frame and enhance visual storytelling, specifically in those contexts. I enjoy working on side projects that explore using the web as a creative product, and not just another outlet for advertising and information.</p>
